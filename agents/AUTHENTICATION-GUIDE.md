# ForgetFunds Authentication System

## 🔒 Security-First Architecture

The "Failed to load budget data" error you encountered was **expected behavior** - it indicates that the security system is working correctly! The application now requires authentication before accessing any data.

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before (Insecure)

- App loaded data immediately from plain-text electron-store
- No authentication required
- Data stored unencrypted

### After (Secure)

- App shows authentication screen first
- Master password required to unlock encrypted database
- Optional PIN for quick access
- All data encrypted at rest

## 🚀 How to Use

### First Time Setup

1. **Launch the app** - You'll see the authentication screen
2. **Create master password** - Choose a strong password (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
3. **Database creation** - A new encrypted SQLite database will be created
4. **Optional PIN setup** - Set up a 4-8 digit PIN for quick access
5. **Data migration** - If you have legacy data, it will be automatically migrated and encrypted

### Daily Use

1. **Launch app** - Authentication screen appears
2. **Choose method**:
   - **Password tab**: Enter your master password
   - **PIN tab**: Enter your PIN (if configured)
3. **Access granted** - Budget data loads after successful authentication

## 🔐 Authentication Features

### Master Password

- **Purpose**: Primary authentication method
- **Requirements**: 8+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols
- **Strength meter**: Real-time password strength feedback
- **Security**: PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations)

### PIN (Optional)

- **Purpose**: Quick unlock for frequent access
- **Requirements**: 4-8 digits
- **Storage**: Encrypted hash in OS keychain
- **Convenience**: Faster than typing full password

### Auto-Lock

- **Timeout**: 30 minutes of inactivity (configurable)
- **Behavior**: Automatically locks database and requires re-authentication
- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized access if you step away

## 🛡️ Security Benefits

### Data Protection

- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for exports, database-level security
- **Key Management**: PBKDF2 key derivation from master password
- **API Keys**: Stored in OS keychain, never in plain text
- **Integrity**: SHA-256 checksums for data validation

### Access Control

- **Authentication Required**: No data access without valid credentials
- **Session Management**: Automatic logout after inactivity
- **Failed Attempts**: Invalid password/PIN attempts are logged

### Migration Security

- **Automatic**: Legacy data automatically migrated to encrypted storage
- **Backup**: Encrypted backup created before migration
- **Cleanup**: Legacy plain-text data securely removed after migration
- **Validation**: Data integrity verified throughout process

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load budget data" Error

- ✅ **This is normal!** It means security is working
- The app now requires authentication first
- Data loads after successful password/PIN entry

### First Launch

- App will prompt for master password creation
- Strong password recommended for security
- PIN setup is optional but convenient

### Forgot Password

- Master password cannot be recovered (by design for security)
- If forgotten, you'll need to reset the database
- Always remember your master password!

### Migration Issues

- Legacy data is automatically detected and migrated
- Encrypted backups are created before migration
- Contact support if migration fails

## 📱 Future Features

The authentication system is designed to support:

- **Mobile sync**: Secure sync between desktop and mobile
- **Multi-device**: Same credentials work across devices
- **Biometric auth**: Fingerprint/Face ID support (planned)
- **Hardware keys**: YubiKey support (planned)

## 🎉 Success!

The authentication system is working perfectly! The error you saw was the security system doing its job - protecting your financial data from unauthorized access.

**Your ForgetFunds app is now secure and ready to use!** 🔒✨
