# Authentication Fix Summary

## 🔍 **Problem Identified**

- App was bypassing authentication in frontend but backend was still enforcing it
- This caused "App is locked - please authenticate first" errors
- Auth screen wasn't showing because frontend thought user was authenticated
- 30+ Zustand logs were from the automatic debug script running repeatedly

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Restored Proper Authentication Flow**

- `src/App.tsx` now properly calls `checkAuthStatus()`
- Backend auth status is respected in frontend
- Auth screen will show when user needs to authenticate

### 2. **Enhanced Logging**

- Added comprehensive logging to `check-auth-status` handler in `main.ts`
- Shows detailed auth status breakdown
- Frontend logs authentication decisions clearly

### 3. **Improved Error Handling**

- `loadData()` now properly handles authentication errors
- Sets authentication state correctly on auth failures
- Prevents infinite retry loops

### 4. **Debug Script Cleanup**

- Removed automatic debug script execution
- Debug function available manually: call `debugDataFlow()` in console
- Prevents spam of 30+ logs on startup

## 🎯 **Expected Flow Now**

### On App Launch:

```
🔐 [App] Checking authentication status...
🔍 [App] Querying authentication status from backend...
🔐 [Main] check-auth-status handler called
📋 [Main] Auth status details: { isAppLocked: false, isDbUnlocked: false, ... }
✅ [Main] Returning auth status: { isLocked: true, isAuthenticated: false, ... }
📋 [App] Auth status received: { isLocked: true, isAuthenticated: false, ... }
🔐 [App] User needs to authenticate - showing auth screen
```

### After Authentication:

```
🎉 [App] User authenticated successfully
📂 [App] Loading budget data from SQLite...
✅ [App] Data loaded successfully after authentication
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Start the app**: `npm run dev`
2. **Check console**: Should see proper auth flow logs
3. **Auth screen should appear**: Enter your password/PIN
4. **After auth**: App should load data successfully
5. **Make edits**: Zustand store should save to SQLite properly

## 🔧 **Manual Testing**

If you want to test the data flow after authenticating:

1. Open browser console
2. Call `debugDataFlow()`
3. Watch the detailed data flow logs

The authentication flow should now work correctly and the database should persist data between app restarts!
